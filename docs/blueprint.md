## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B8E3) to convey a calming, friendly assistant vibe.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F3F6), almost white, for a clean and modern look. This pairs well with the lavender primary color while providing sufficient contrast for text.
- Accent color: Pale violet (#B19CD9). Slightly more saturated, and also darker, than the primary. It complements the lavender, but creates contrast for important elements such as the microphone or confirmation buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body.
- Simple, clear icons for microphone, playback, and settings.
- Subtle animation on the microphone icon while recording to give a clear indication of active listening.
